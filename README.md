This program is intended for people with RSI or other injuries to their fingers. 
It greatly reduces repetitive finger clicking by doing most of the clicking for you. 
All you're left to do is move the mouse around.

HOW TO USE:
Just activate the program. (You'll only hear a bleep to indicate that it has activated)
1. Just point the mouse cursor at what you want to click. 
 - The cursor will automatically click whenever it stops moving, except when moving down-right.
 - Move down-right to "park" the mouse without clicking.
 - The cursor will automatically grab hold of right-hand vertical scrollbars, and releases when the cursor moves away from it.
2. Pressing ENTER on a clicked item does the same as a double-click.
3. Hold SHIFT to drag, instead of holding the mouse button.
4. Press F10 to turn auto-clicking on and off.
5. Press F10 and ESCAPE to shut the program down entirely.

TIPS:
- By default leave the mouse "parked" where it is, after a click.
- Make a habit of looking at your target before moving the mouse.
